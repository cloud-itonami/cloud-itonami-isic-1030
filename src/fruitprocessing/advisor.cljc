(ns fruitprocessing.advisor
  "MeatProcessingAdvisor -- the contained LLM/decision node. This actor's
  intelligence layer proposes batch operations based on plant state and
  incoming meat lots. The advisor is SEALED into the `:advise` node of
  the operation graph; every proposal is routed through the independent
  Governor before committing.

  The advisor makes proposals but has NO direct authority. Proposals are
  always censored by:
    1. Governor (food-safety, compliance checks)
    2. Phase gate (rollout stage)
    3. Human operator (for high-stakes actions)

  Current implementation is a mock advisor for testing. Production should
  use langchain/Claude or similar LLM backend (same seam point as
  `refining.refiningadvisor`)."
